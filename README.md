# issues-to-spreadsheets

Extract github issues into Google Spreadsheets // use labels to class them


You will need : 

- a Google account

-  to create a projetct at https://console.developers.google.com/ 

-  to create credentials for web application use and dowload its key as client_secret.json in this very file




To use this script you must :

- rewrite git_secret with your own git credentials



# Enabling Google API

Enable Google SpreadSheet api ( an error link will appear, you'll just need to click on it to go to the right page)

- Download Api Key as client_secret

If your project is not verified you may have to bypass the autorisation the first time launching the script.





#Customizing your datas

To know what aspect of the application is explored in an issue:

Create labels starting with "Feat:", for exemple "Feat:User"
To estimate the length of an issue:

Create labels starting with "Est:", for exemple "Est:1-3 days"


You can create as many labels and columns as you'd like.

Thank you for using this script!
